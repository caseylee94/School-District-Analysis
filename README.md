# School-District-Analysis

## Overview

The school board has notified Maria that there has been academic dishonesty in the reporting of grades, specifically for Thomas High School 9th graders. The purpose of this project is to remove the reading and math scores from Thomas High School for the 9th grade class, replace the scores with NaN, and repeat the school district analysis. The analysis is determining the district summary statistics, the individual school summary statistics, the math and reading scores by grade, the scores by school spending, the scores by school size, and the scores by school type. 

## Results

  * New School Summary:

 * The percent overall passing dropped from 90.95% to 65.08%
 * The average math score dropped from 83.42% to 83.35%
 * The average reading score dropped from 83.85% to 83.90%
 * The reason the percent overall passing dropped much less than the average scores is because the NaN values are effectively appearing as "0" for some students and the average scores are based on the number of students; the grades that have been replaced with NaN are not being represented in the average causing the scores to appear lower. The percent overall passing is a better indicator of how the scores have changed and is only based on the remaining scores, still has lowered since the dishonest reportings were removed.
