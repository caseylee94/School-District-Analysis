# School-District-Analysis

## Overview

The school board has notified Maria that there has been academic dishonesty in the reporting of grades, specifically for Thomas High School 9th graders. The purpose of this project is to remove the reading and math scores from Thomas High School for the 9th grade class, replace the scores with NaN, and repeat the school district analysis. The analysis is determining the district summary statistics, the individual school summary statistics, the math and reading scores by grade, the scores by school spending, the scores by school size, and the scores by school type. 

## Results

* The school distric summary was only affected in regards to Thomas High School as all the other schools remained the same. The images showing the old and new school summary are shown below:
